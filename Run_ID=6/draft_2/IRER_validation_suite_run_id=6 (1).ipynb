        "The V11.0 \"HPC-SDG\" build represents a critical architectural pivot for the Information-Reality Emergence (IRER) framework. This suite is engineered to resolve two foundational issues identified in the V10.x series: the catastrophic \"pipeline deadlock\" that stalled the automated discovery loop, and the profound scientific contradiction termed the \"Stability-Fidelity Paradox.\" The core scientific objective is the strategic transition from the mathematically non-compliant Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) solver to the axiomatically correct, JAX-native Spacetime-Density Gravity (SDG) solver.

This phase refactors the core logic from the standalone script in Phase 3 into an importable module (core_engine.py) to be driven by a persistent, non-blocking web server (app.py), enabling full, multi-generational hunts. This refactoring is the strategic pivot away from simple scripts to a scalable control plane. In its place, we implement a lightweight, scalable Flask-based \"Dynamic Control Hub.\" This hub follows a clean three-part architecture: a non-blocking Flask backend (app.py), a refactored core engine module (core_engine.py), and a single-page HTML interface (index.html). This design enables rapid iteration and transparent execution monitoring. Before the HTML interface is generated, a helper directory required by the Flask framework will be created. First, we will generate the refactored core engine.\n",

        "The V11.0 suite represents a critical strategic pivot from previous iterations of the scientific computing framework. It is designed to resolve foundational architectural deadlocks and profound scientific contradictions that emerged during the V10.x research campaigns. The primary mandate of V11.0 is to establish a stable, verifiable, and scalable high-performance computing (HPC) platform, enabling the next phase of advanced research by unifying the system's computational architecture with its core theoretical principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.1. Strategic Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "The V11.0 release is guided by three non-negotiable strategic objectives that address the core failures of the previous architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Achieve Foundational Closure: The V11 architecture is built upon a physics model derived axiomatically from the project's core Fields of Minimal Informational Action (FMIA) Lagrangian, denoted as \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{FMIA}}. Applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to this Lagrangian yields the true, relativistic master wave equation. The Sourced, Non-Local Complex Ginzburg-Landau (S-NCGL) equation used in the computation is the confirmed standard non-equilibrium, non-relativistic limit of this master equation. This crucial step elevates the project from utilizing a \"borrowed analogue\" to employing a complete, predictive scientific theory derived from its own first principles.\n",
        "* Resolve the 'Stability-Fidelity Paradox': A critical failure of the V10.1 architecture was the discovery of a strong positive correlation (+0.72) between high physical coherence (measured by the Phase Coherence Score, or PCS) and high geometric instability (measured by the Hamiltonian constraint violation, or H-Norm L2). This paradox meant that the most scientifically valuable simulations were also the most numerically unstable. V11.0 resolves this by replacing the falsified Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) solver with the mathematically compliant, JAX-native Spacetime-Density Gravity (SDG) solver, which is compatible with the physics sourced by the S-NCGL model.\n",
        "* Implement the Unified Hashing Mandate: The V10.x development campaign was terminated by a catastrophic \"Orchestrator-Hunter Desynchronization\" deadlock. This was caused by a fatal architectural flaw where each distributed component independently calculated a non-deterministic hash for a given job, leading to a file-not-found state that stalled the entire pipeline. The V11.0 hotfix establishes the orchestrator as the sole source of truth for a job's unique identifier (UUID), which is then passed as a command-line argument to all downstream components. This guarantees data integrity and resolves the pipeline stall permanently.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.2. Success Criteria\n",
        "\n",
        "The formal, quantitative success criteria for the V11.0 project are defined by a primary scientific goal and a non-negotiable termination condition for the automated research campaign.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Primary Scientific Goal: The ultimate scientific objective is to validate the \"Log-Prime Spectral Attractor\" hypothesis. This theory posits that stable emergent structures within the simulation will self-organize into spectral resonance modes corresponding to the natural logarithms of prime numbers (wavevectors k \\approx \\ln(p)).\n",
        "* Termination Condition: The success of the V11.0 suite is measured by a single, non-negotiable metric. The autonomous Hunter-Worker pipeline must discover a stable parameter regime that successfully replicates the Log-Prime Spectral Attractor with a Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) of ≤ 0.001. This target is benchmarked against the project's \"gold standard\" results from the RhoSim simulation engine (SSE ≈ 0.00087) and deconvolved data from Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) quantum optics experiments (SSE ≈ 0.0015).\n",
        "\n",
        "The following sections detail the system architecture designed to achieve these objectives and provide operational guidance for its implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. System Architecture and Data Flow\n",
        "\n",
        "The V11.0 architecture is the direct implementation of the project's \"HPC Modularity and Scalability Mandate.\" Its decoupled, two-layer design is a structural requirement to separate components with fundamentally different and non-overlapping computational profiles. This design isolates the massively parallel, accelerator-bound physics kernel (the JAX Worker) from the sequential, CPU-bound, and I/O-heavy tasks of the Hunter AI and the secondary analysis suite. This separation of concerns is the key enabler for high-throughput, autonomous discovery campaigns, ensuring the high-performance core is never blocked by computationally distinct tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.1. The Two-Layer Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "The V11.0 system is strictly divided into two operational layers, each with a distinct role and set of components.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Layer 1: The JAX-Optimized HPC Core: This is the \"locked\" high-performance layer, reserved exclusively for executing the core physics loop of the evolutionary hunt. It comprises the minimal set of JAX-optimized components required for high-throughput generation of scientific solutions. Its components include the Hunter AI (aste_hunter.py), the S-NCGL Worker, and the SDG Geometric Solver (both encapsulated within worker_sncgl_sdg.py).\n",
        "* Layer 2: The Decoupled Secondary Analysis Suite: This is an asynchronous post-processing layer designed for complex, high-overhead analysis. Tools such as Topological Data Analysis (TDA) or advanced plotting modules are formally demoted to this layer. They operate on the completed simulation artifacts generated by Layer 1, ensuring that their longer runtimes or heavy I/O operations do not stall the primary R&D campaign.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.2. Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "The V11.0 suite is composed of several key Python scripts that work in concert to execute the full simulation and analysis workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "Script Name\tRole\tDescription\n",
        "app.py\tDynamic Control Hub\tThe decoupled control plane for the entire suite. Its background Watcher thread implements the asynchronous, event-driven link between the completion of Layer 1 jobs and the initiation of Layer 2 analysis.\n",
        "core_engine.py\tCore Orchestrator\tThe callable HPC orchestrator module that executes the synchronous, high-throughput evolutionary loop of Layer 1. It is launched as a non-blocking thread to manage the lifecycle of Worker and Validator subprocesses.\n",
        "settings.py\tCentral Configuration\tThe architectural lynchpin for system-wide auditability and reproducibility. It enforces the single-source-of-truth principle for all file paths, script names, and configuration parameters.\n",
        "aste_hunter.py\tAdaptive Learning Engine\tThe \"Brain\" of the system. It implements the evolutionary algorithm, processing validation results from the master ledger to \"breed\" new generations of simulation parameters.\n",
        "worker_sncgl_sdg.py\tHPC Physics Worker\tThe JAX-native S-NCGL/SDG physics kernel. It executes the core simulation on a hardware accelerator (GPU/TPU) and saves its output as a rho_history_{UUID}.h5 data artifact.\n",
        "validation_pipeline_v11.py\tPrimary Validator\tThe streamlined Layer 1 validator, intentionally stripped of all high-overhead or I/O-bound analysis. Its sole mandate is to perform the high-speed checks required for the Hunter's fitness calculation, preventing pipeline stalls.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.3. End-to-End Data Flow\n",
        "\n",
        "The complete data and execution flow for a simulation hunt is a well-defined, ten-step process orchestrated by the Control Hub and Core Engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initiation: The user accesses the index.html UI in a web browser and clicks the \"Start New Hunt\" button, which sends a request to the /api/start-hunt endpoint on app.py.\n",
        "2. Dispatch: app.py immediately returns a 202 Accepted response to the UI and launches the core_engine.execute_hunt() function in a new, non-blocking background thread.\n",
        "3. Generation Loop: The core_engine.py thread begins the hunt, calling aste_hunter.py to select and breed a batch of candidate parameters for the new generation.\n",
        "4. Job Execution: For each parameter set, core_engine.py generates a unique job_uuid, saves the parameters to a config_{job_uuid}.json file, and launches the worker_sncgl_sdg.py script as a separate subprocess, passing the UUID as a command-line argument.\n",
        "5. Artifact Generation: The Worker completes its JAX-based simulation and saves its full time-series output as a rho_history_{job_uuid}.h5 HDF5 file.\n",
        "6. Validation: Upon the successful completion of the Worker, core_engine.py launches the validation_pipeline_v11.py script, passing the same job_uuid. The Validator loads the HDF5 artifact and saves its calculated metrics as a provenance_{job_uuid}.json file.\n",
        "7. Detection: The background \"Watcher\" thread, running continuously within app.py, detects the creation of the new provenance file in the provenance_reports directory.\n",
        "8. Status Update: The Watcher reads the key metrics (e.g., SSE, H-Norm) from the newly detected provenance file and updates the central status.json file.\n",
        "9. Monitoring: The index.html dashboard, which periodically polls the /api/get-status endpoint, receives the updated status from status.json and displays the live metrics to the user in near-real-time.\n",
        "10. Cycle Completion: After all jobs in a generation are complete, core_engine.py invokes aste_hunter.py to process all the new provenance reports, calculate fitness scores, and update the master aste_hunt_ledger.csv. The loop then repeats for the next generation.\n",

        "2. Install Dependencies: Install the required packages directly within the notebook using !pip. Note the inclusion of pyngrok for network tunneling.\n",
        "3. Expose the UI: Colab instances run on a private network. To access the Control Hub UI, the Flask server's port (8080) must be exposed to the public internet using a tunneling service like pyngrok. After launching the server, you will need to find the unique public URL generated by pyngrok in the notebook's output logs.\n",

        "  * Via the UI: The \"Hunt Status\" section of the control panel will update in near-real-time as new provenance files are generated and processed by the Watcher thread, displaying the latest SSE and other key metrics.\n",
        "  * Via the Logs: For more detailed insight, you can tail the main log file in a separate terminal window. This provides a live, timestamped stream of events from the Control Hub, Core Engine, Worker, and Validator processes.\n",

        "5.2. My hunt stalled. Where should I look for errors?\n",
        "\n",
        "The first and most important place to check for errors is the main log file, typically located at logs/control_hub.log. The core_engine.py orchestrator is designed to capture the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams from the worker and validator subprocesses it launches. Therefore, any failures within those scripts, such as a JAX compilation error in the worker or a file-not-found error in the validator, will be redirected and recorded in this central log file with a timestamp.\n",

        "* Layer 2 (The Analysis Suite) includes components for deeper, often slower, post-processing analysis. For example, the tda_taxonomy_validator.py script, which performs complex Topological Data Analysis, is a Layer 2 component. These tools are run asynchronously or after a hunt is complete, ensuring they do not block the primary scientific discovery process.\n",

        "5.5. Why was the Dask/Celery concept decommissioned?\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on a formal architectural review, distributed task frameworks like Dask and Celery were classified as \"non-viable\" and \"unnecessarily complex\" for the project's current R&D context. The high operational overhead of managing message brokers and distributed task queues was found to be a mismatch for the core requirements of rapid iteration and simple scalability from a single Colab instance to a small VM fleet. The current architecture—a Flask server orchestrating subprocess calls—was chosen for its simplicity, lower overhead, and direct alignment with the project's immediate operational needs.\n"

It serves as the sole source for deterministic UUIDs/config\\_hashes by creating a content-based hash for configuration parameters and orchestrates the worker and validator subprocesses.\n",
        "*   **Decoupled Validation**: The `validation_pipeline_v11.py` module was successfully created. This module replaces previous validation pipelines, incorporating core scientific metric calculations such as Log-Prime SSE and Phase Coherence Score (PCS), along with a placeholder for an SDG stability metric. It is designed to save a \"provenance.json\" artifact as a \"receipt\" of the simulation run.\n",

        "    *   `solver_sdg.py` was successfully generated, containing the JAX-native Spacetime-Density Gravity (SDG) solver library, including a Jacobi-Poisson solver and functions for calculating informational stress-energy.\n",
        "    *   `worker_sncgl.py` was also successfully generated, implementing the S-NCGL Equations of Motion (EOM) coupled with the SDG solver, handling the co-evolutionary simulation and artifact saving.\n",
        "*   **Adaptive Hunt Core and Control Hub**:\n",
        "    *   `core_engine.py`, which encapsulates the refactored adaptive hunt core logic, and `app.py`, the Flask meta-orchestrator and dynamic control hub, were successfully created.\n",
        "    *   An initial attempt to generate the web UI (`templates/index.html`) failed due to a missing `templates` directory; this was resolved by explicitly creating the directory, after which `index.html` was successfully written. This HTML file provides a live status dashboard for the Control Hub.\n",
        "*   **Centralized Configuration**: The `settings.py` file was successfully updated with the V11.0 configuration. It centralizes essential parameters, including core directory paths, script names (`worker_sncgl.py` and `validation_pipeline_v11.py`), evolutionary hunt parameters, and critical data contract keys, ensuring consistent use across all components.\n",

        "Yes, the `app.py` was updated with `/api/get-run-log/<job_id>` and `/api/get-full-log` API endpoints, and `templates/index.html` was updated with corresponding UI buttons and a log display area.\n",

        "**2. Was the provenance download functionality successfully implemented?**\n",
        "Yes, the `app.py` was updated with the `/api/download-provenance/<job_id>` API endpoint, and `templates/index.html` includes a button to trigger this download.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Was the correct display of the `SDG H-Norm L2` metric in the Control Hub UI confirmed?**\n",
        "Yes, the `templates/index.html` file was updated to use `parseFloat().toFixed(6)` for the `last_h_norm` value, ensuring a robust and correctly formatted display of the `SDG H-Norm L2` metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **API Endpoint Implementation:** The `app.py` file was successfully modified to include three new API endpoints:\n",
        "    *   `/api/get-run-log/<job_id>`: Retrieves log content for a specific job ID.\n",
        "    *   `/api/download-provenance/<job_id>`: Facilitates the download of the `provenance_{job_id}.json` file.\n",
        "    *   `/api/get-full-log`: Provides the full `control_hub.log` file for download.\n",
        "*   **UI Feature Integration:** The `templates/index.html` file was updated to integrate new UI elements, including buttons for \"Download Full Log\", \"View Log\" for specific jobs, and \"Download Provenance\" for specific jobs. A dedicated `<pre>` element was added for displaying job-specific logs.\n",
        "*   **Metric Display Correction:** A bug was fixed in `templates/index.html` to ensure the `SDG H-Norm L2` metric (`last_h_norm`) is robustly displayed by formatting it to 6 decimal places using `parseFloat().toFixed(6)`.\n",
        "*   **Provenance Watcher Enhancement:** The `ProvenanceWatcher` in `app.py` was refined to specifically filter for files containing \"provenance_\" in their name when monitoring the `PROVENANCE_DIR`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The implemented features significantly enhance the monitoring and debugging capabilities of the Control Hub by providing direct access to logs and provenance reports from the UI.\n",
        "*   The next logical step is to perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of these new UI features and their corresponding API endpoints to ensure they function as expected and handle various scenarios gracefully.\n"
