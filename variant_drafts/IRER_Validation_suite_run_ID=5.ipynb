        "*   **Central Configuration**: An initial `settings.py` file was established, centralizing configuration parameters for Generation 1 specifications, and later updated to reflect V11.0 changes, including the new `WORKER_SCRIPT` (`worker_sncgl_sdg.py`) and defining critical data contract keys like `SSE_METRIC_KEY` and `STABILITY_METRIC_KEY`.\n",
